doomdumper:  Check for UAC elevation..!!!!


-----appdata\local\ config stores: last version of game dumped, aborted state, path of last game dump---------


set reg value. (sideloading)

get package info --> Check version, bool DeveloperMode // or fail if not available (oob error??)

dump to set path (with modified uwpinjector as linkable interface, async progress reports) {idea: UWPdumper::InjectorInterface::dump() -> asyncReport() : Object}

remove old installation, register new at dumped path  (aync progress reports!!! [need to read up on this])

figure out how to keep addons OR a better way to redirect to store (winapi is not an option: class members are private and Microsoft only)

DONE??
